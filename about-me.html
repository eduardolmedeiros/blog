<h1 id="posts-label">About me</h1>

<h2>Hello, there!</h2>

<p>I'm Eduardo, System engineer, former SysAdmin and father, living in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Working as a System engineer is not boring for me because I love what I do and I put a lot of passion for that.</p>

<p>When I've some free time, I like to contribute to opensource projects and coding for having fun.</p>

<p>As a hobby, I do love practicing martial arts such as BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu).</p>
<br />

<p>Currently, I'm working at <a href="http://www.tomtom.com">TomTom</a>, close to the developers to build and deliver infrastructure to support critical applications with solutions based on open source technologies.</p>

<p>During my daily routine, I'm responsible for developing and improving for provisioning and configuration management recipes for efficient and reliable deployments and maintenances.</p>
Feel free to reach me out on social media.
<br />

<p>Thanks for reading my blog!</p>
<p>Eduardo.</p>
