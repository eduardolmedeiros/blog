<p>

<h2>Hello, there!</h2>

I'm Eduardo, System engineer, former SysAdmin and father, living in the Netherlands.
<br />
Working as a System engineer is not boring for me because I love what I do and I put a lot of passion for that.
<br />
When I've some free time, I like to contribute to opensource projects and coding for having fun.
<br />
As a hobby, I do love practicing martial arts such as BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu).
<br />
Currently, I'm working at <a href="http://www.tomtom.com">TomTom</a>, close to the developers to build and deliver infrastructure to support critical applications with solutions based on open source technologies.
<br />
During my daily days, I'm responsible for developing and improving for provisioning and configuration management recipes for efficient and reliable deployments and maintenances.
<br />
Feel free to reach me out on social media.
<br />
Thanks for reading my blog!
<br />
Eduardo.
